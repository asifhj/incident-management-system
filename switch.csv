1.2.2.3 - Forbid Finger Service - IOS 12.0,"Disable finger server. For IOS 12.0, this rule is designed to ""fail"" every time. This forces the fix to be applied with each run of RAT.

This makes it impossible, by looking at the configuration, to determine if finger has been turned off.  Because of this, it is always assumed to be turned on and the fix to turn it off is applied every time.
